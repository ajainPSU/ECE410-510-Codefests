QR Code Analyzer

This is a toy example for the QR Code Analyzer (file IB.py)

This code was generated with GPT 4o & Copilot and is the first step of the project.

# Create a toy QR code-like binary image (5x5 grid)
toy_qr_code = np.array([
    [255, 255, 255, 255, 255],

# Import the QRCodeRecognizer class from IB.py
from IB import QRCodeRecognizer

# Initialize the recognizer in trace mode for debugging
recognizer = QRCodeRecognizer(trace_mode=True)

# Step 1: Load the toy image
img = recognizer.load_image(toy_image_path)

# Step 2: Threshold the image
binary = recognizer.threshold_image(img)

# Step 3: Find finder patterns (this will likely fail for a toy example, but it's part of the workflow)
finder_patterns = recognizer.find_finder_patterns(binary)

# Step 4: Extract the QR grid (mock finder patterns for simplicity)
mock_finder_patterns = [(0, 0), (4, 0), (0, 4)]  # Top-left, top-right, bottom-left

# Step 5: Decode the QR code (mock codewords for simplicity)
# Mock a valid bitstream for the decode_payload method
# Assuming the first 4 bits are mode (e.g., "byte" mode = 0100),
# the next 8 bits are the length (e.g., 3 characters = 00000011),
# followed by the actual payload (ASCII for 'A', 'B', 'C').

mock_bits = (
    "0100"  # Mode: Byte mode
    "00000011"  # Length: 3 characters
    "01000001"  # 'A'
    "01000010"  # 'B'
    "01000011"  # 'C'
)

# Decode the payload
payload = recognizer.decode_payload(mock_bits, mode="byte")

# Print the results
print("Decoded Payload:", payload)

# Print the results
print("Decoded Payload:", payload)
